# geoLab @ William & Mary

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the geoLab at William & Mary. Our mission is to create and promote vibrant societies of data driven policymakers. We focus on providing free access to essential datasets and technologies, conducting research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, satellite imagery and big data, and cultivating the next generation of leaders skilled in using data for making informed decisions.

## Our Research

Our lab engages in a variety of research activities, with recent publications covering topics focused on generating and analyzing very large spatially-explicit datasets (especially satellite imagery). A complete list of our publications can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/wmgeolab/our-research).
